# Ball system
## Introduction
This is an interesting ball system built using OpenGL. It allows for the creation and manipulation of various balls in a 3D environment. Features include the ability to change the size and color of the balls, as well as the ability to apply forces and make them bounce off of each other and the walls of the environment. You can also define your own physical rules here. I'm currently building it for fun:).

## Platform
- OS: Windows
- tools: Visual Studio 2019
- The OpenGL scaffold is located in the OpenGL-Core folder and includes vendor files. It can be used as a starting point for creating projects using OpenGL.
